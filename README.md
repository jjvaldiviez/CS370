The importance of gathering data for the use of artificial intelligence is to build up a neural network that can identify patterns in the data.
The more data is added to the neural network, the more intelligent the agent is. Some might say that artificial intelligence should not gather
vast amounts of data because it may violate privacy. The problem is that intelligent agents need a lot of data to be smarter at what it does. 

This repo has code to an intelligent agent of a pirate game. The goal of the game is to find treasure. The intelligent agent uses Q-Learning along 
with exploration to find the best possible path to the treasure. It does this by learning the environment first, then by gathering data and adding them 
as weights to find the best possible path. All this data is added to its neural network. Once the intelligent agent has learned, it can now play the game 
and solve it.
